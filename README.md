# SpecSWD
**SpecSWD**  is a software to compute surface wave dispersions and do sensitivity analysis for 1-D fully anisotropic, wealy anelastic media. It utilizes spectral element method and quadratic eigenvalue solver to handle multiphysics (elastic-acoustic coupling), strong anisotropy and discontinuities inside the study region.  

**SpecSWD** also provides high-level sensitivity analysis framework (adjoint methods) for any user-defined quantities.

For installation, user manual, please refer to [docs](https://nqdu.github.io/SpecSWD/).
